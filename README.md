# NASM Find Prime Numbers

Prime-Numbers-NASM.nasm is a pure x86-64 implementation of a prime number algorithm. First the program generates an array containing every number from 0-100,000 and then proceeds to iterate through it and apply the prime number algorithm to each integer. If the integer is a prime number it is added to another array, which is printed out before exiting.
